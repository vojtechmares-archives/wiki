# Git

Git is the standard tool to version (not only) your source code.

Git has exploded in popularity because of platforms such as [GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org).

Git was made by Linus Torvalds. When he started writing the Linux Kernel, there was no VCS which he like, so he wrote a new one.

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

Probably the most popular repository hosting.

## [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)

My personal favorite, because of it's integrated CI which is really simple yet powerful.
